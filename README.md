### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

Iâ€™m [**Milhane**](https://milhanechiheb.com), a JavaScript developer living in France.

Passionate about computer science since childhood, I took my first steps by creating and selling addons on Garry's Mod. 
Today, I develop complete web applications, from backend to frontend, with particular attention to quality, user experience and detail.

But Iâ€™m not just a developer. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me playing guitar (often blasting some metal or Weezer) or watching anime.
I love exploring the intersection between tech, storytelling, and artâ€”sometimes by building haunted video games or planting clues in spectrograms.

Random fact but Neon Genesis Evangelion is my favorite anime.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into low-level development. Iâ€™m currently learning C++ so I can eventually build PlayStation 1 games from scratch, and Iâ€™m also really interested in learning Rust for its performance and safety.
I'm always looking to push the limits of what I can buildâ€”especially when it feels a bit weird, broken, or nostalgic.
